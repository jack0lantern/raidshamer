# Raid Shamer
Takes a screenshot of deaths. Also supports discord webhook integration. Previously named Raid Shamer.

You can toggle whether this shames your own deaths.
You can toggle whether to shame all deaths (default) or only your friends' deaths.
You can toggle whether this shames people on a per-raid basis and/or outside of raids.

This plugin by default just saves a photo of a death to a folder called "Wall of Shame." I'm assuming if you're reading this, you are looking for discord webhook information.

## Example Discord Webhook message

Note: This particular screenshot is compressed/low quality due to editing (adding the censors). Screenshots taken by the plugin are crisp and uncensored.

## How to set up the webhook

First off you will need permissions in a Discord channel, or the ability to make your own.

Click the settings gear beside a channel, then integrations, and then "View Webhooks." Click on "New Webhook."

Enter in a name, select the channel, then optionally upload a profile photo. Save your changes and click "Copy Webhook URL."

Open up Runelite and go to the settings for Death Shamer. Click the box to turn on Discord Webhook support and then paste the URL into the text box.

This is not malicious and your webhook will never be sent to anyone else. That's all there is to it.
